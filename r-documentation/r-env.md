# R

R is an open-source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. More information on R can be found on the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). A useful set of R manuals is also hosted on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html).

## Available

The `r-env` module module has been built for diverse use cases and includes 800+ pre-installed R packages, including support for geospatial analyses. Several [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) packages are also included. Bioconductor is an open-source project providing tools for the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.

Currently supported R versions:

- 3.6.1

Currently supported Bioconductor versions:

- 3.9 (with R 3.6.1)

Other software included in the module:

- GRASS 7.8.0 and Saga-GIS 7.3.0 (with R 3.6.1)

## Licenses

Information on licenses that are in use for R and associated software (such as packages) can be found on the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/).

## Usage

#### Loading the module

To use the default version of this module on Puhti, initialize it with:

```
module load r-env
```

Note that Puhti login nodes are not intended for heavy computing. To use R in Puhti, please either request an interactive job in a computing node or submit a non-interactive batch job in Slurm. 

#### Interactive use

To interactively use R on Puhti's computational nodes, run this command after initializing the `r-env` module. This will request a single-processor R session. Note that you will need to modify the requested duration, memory, project ID and partition as required:

```
srun -n1 -t hh:mm:ss --x11=first --mem=4G --pty --account=project_id -p partition R --no-save 
```

For information on available partitions, see [here](https://docs.csc.fi/#computing/running/batch-job-partitions/#puhti-partitions).

**Note:** RStudio is currently unavailable on Puhti, but is included in future installation plans.

#### Non-interactive use

You can also run R scripts non-interactively using batch job files. This is particularly useful for jobs that require multiple cores or a lot of memory. See this [link](https://docs.csc.fi/#computing/running/creating-job-scripts/) for detailed information on how to prepare batch jobs. Information on submitting array jobs can be found [here](https://docs.csc.fi/#computing/running/array-jobs/).

An example for submitting a single-processor R batch job on Puhti:

```
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH -J r_single_proc
#SBATCH -o output_%j.txt
#SBATCH -e errors_%j.txt
#SBATCH -p test
#SBATCH -t 00:05:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000

module load r-env
srun Rscript --no-save myrscript.R
```

#### R package installations

It is possible to check if a particular package is already installed as follows.

```r
# One way is to try loading the package:
library(packagename)

# If you don't want to load the package, it is also
# possible to search through a list:
installed_packages <- library()$results[,1]
"packagename" %in% installed_packages

# Note: both ways are sensitive to upper- and lower-case letters
```

Additional R package installations can be arranged via two separate routes:

- Project-specific installations can be used by creating a separate package directory in the `/projappl/<project>` directory (instructions below; also see [here](https://docs.csc.fi/#computing/disk/#projappl-directory) for information on ProjAppl)

- Requests for general installations (provided to all users as part of the module): please contact [servicedesk@csc.fi](mailto:servicedesk@csc.fi)

To make use of a project-specific package library, follow these instructions:

```r
# Outside R (on the command line):
# First navigate to /projappl/<project>, then
mkdir Project_RPackages

# Add the following to your R code:
.libPaths(c("/projappl/<project>/Project_RPackages", .libPaths()))
libpath <- .libPaths()[1]

# This command can be used to check that the folder is now visible:
.libPaths() # It should be first on the list

# Package installations should now be directed to the project
# folder by default. You can also specify the path, e.g.:
install.packages("Package", lib = libpath)
```

## Citation

For finding out the correct citations for R and different R packages, you can type:

```r
citation() # for citing R
citation("package") # for citing R packages
```
